# Topological Change Point Detection
## Discovering Tipping Points in Time Series Data
Change point detection is an important topic in time-series analysis covering a broad range of applications where it is required to detect significant divergence from a nominal behavior in systems characterized by their measurable time-series. Several real-world systems include solar flare clusters, firefly flash patterns, neurological spike trains, climate data and financial indices, to name a few.
